# Before Starting

## How It All Started

To put on my portfolio, i wanted to make a web application that would show my understanding of basics. I didn't want to do neither heavy backend nor heavy front end app. But not easy either. I kept thinking and came to the conclusion that a fully functional chess site would be best.

I also wanted to document every step of the process from start to end. As of this moment, i have a notepad open and writing this and listening to Haul Away Joe by Topgallant Jack have nothing else.


## My Plan

So far, my plan goes like this;
- Decide for a name for the site, so i can open a github repository xd
- Decide what functionalities the web site will have.
- Design the web site on Figma.
- Decide which technologies i will use for the project.
- Research about how i'm gonna implement the required functionalities with the technologies i'm gonna use.
- Make a plan of building, so that i can build the site step by step and test whatever i built.
- Build

## The Name

I decided to call it Bomchess for no particular reason.

## Functionalities (so far)

- Authentication
- Profile pages
- Sending messages to other users
- PvP
- Chat during PvP
- Duel with a Player
- Playing with a bot
- Different match lengths
- Match Replay
- Admin panel; Banning users, inspecting reported games and private messages
- Reporting games, private messages.
